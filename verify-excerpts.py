"""Verify every fenced YAML block in the hand-authored pages.

The rule this enforces: a block is EITHER a verbatim excerpt of a committed source
file, OR a deliberately synthetic template the prose frames as one ("write it
directly", "declare a bed"). Nothing else is allowed.

Why it exists in this shape: an earlier version keyed blocks by their top-level
name and did `if not owner: continue`. That silently skipped 9 of 15 blocks —
including one that quoted a `plan:` which had never existed in any revision — while
reporting a confident "116/116 verify verbatim". A checker that skips what it does
not recognise reports success on what it never checked. So an unclassified block is
now a FAILURE, not a skip, and the counts below are of blocks, not just lines.

Usage: python3 docs/verify-excerpts.py          (run from the superproject root)
